## Important things to know

- This workshop was created using nextjs, rather than running <br/> npm start <br/> you need to run <br/>npm run dev

## Repo for Project

[https://github.com/tmat06/workshop-react-spring](https://github.com/tmat06/workshop-react-spring)

## Objective for Workshop

- To introduce students to the power of React-Spring, an animation library specializing in interpolating data using primitives.
- Simple examples to encourage students to experiment and implement into their future projects.
- Focusing on Transitioning Components and Trailing Effects

## Structure, timing, order

Currently there are 4 React-Spring features that will be displayed. Sample code is presented with each example. <br/>
4 - 5 minutes per example

- You're encouraged to experiment with the examples and to mess with the code. Also encourage students to play around with the code as well while watching the workshop, specifically the Spring feature.

### Build Together

8 minutes

- Attached is an article talking about the benefits of using React-Spring over other animation libraries. This should be replacing React-Motion as it can interpolate data in a much smoother manner while still being able to manipulate visual features with primitive variables. Review the attached article as well as examples given on the documentation. Also note that trying to code Trailing variables can be very difficult but with React-Spring it's a breeze. React-Spring also makes it possible to have components enter and exit in style, something which was very difficult to do in previous animation libraries and vanilla css.

### Questions

2 minutes

- Open for questions. Answers should be given through the documentation. Clarification of simple code examples or more advanced questions of data flow can be answered at this time.

### Final Thoughts

- The objective is to expose students to React-Spring and to show them how easy it is to implement into their projects. With just a few lines of code, their projects can be animated in smooth transitions. This should also encourage students to experiment with React-Spring over other animation libraries such as React-Motion.
